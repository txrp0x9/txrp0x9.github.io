## Website

The website made for this assignment can be found at -
[Clique Listing Algorithms](https://txrp0x9.github.io/)

## Usage

Input file should be a list of edges 0 indexed in `input.txt`

### Tomita

Run the following code in a terminal.

```bash
g++ tomita.cpp
sudo ./a.out
```

### ELS

Run the following code in a terminal.

```bash
g++ els.cpp
sudo ./a.out
```

### Chiba

Run the following code in a terminal.

```bash
g++ chiba.cpp
sudo ./a.out
```

Output for the code will be saved in `maximum_cliques.txt`.

Terminal will display the final runtime and biggest maximal clique size in the end.

## Dataset Preparation

Comments are removed for all dataset txt file.

For Wiki-Vote, it is converted to a 0 indexed file, which can be found available linked.
The rest are as is downloaded from the original sources.

For chiba first input the nodes and edges seperated by space.
