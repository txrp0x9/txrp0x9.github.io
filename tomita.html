    <h1>Worst-case Time Complexity for Maximal Cliques</h1>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> A depth-first search algorithm for generating all maximal cliques of an undirected graph, in which pruning methods
        are employed as in the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm. All the maximal cliques generated are output in a tree-like form. Subsequently,
        we prove that its worst-case time complexity is O(3n/3) for an n-vertex graph. This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist
        up to 3n/3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational
        experiments.This algorithm is a refined variant of the Bron-Kerbosch recursive method, enhanced with a pivot selection strategy. In this method, three disjoint sets of vertices are maintained: - P: the set of candidate vertices for inclusion in the clique, - R: the clique constructed so far, and - X: the set of vertices that have already been processed (excluded from the current clique).

        The recursion terminates when both P and X are empty, at which point R represents a maximal clique. Otherwise, the algorithm selects a pivot vertex u from P ∪ X such that u has the largest number of neighbors in P. It then iterates over each vertex v in P that is not adjacent to u, and recursively calls the algorithm with updated sets: - P is replaced by P ∩ neighbours(v), - R is updated to R ∪ {v}, and - X becomes X ∩ neighbours(v).
    
        After the recursive call returns, v is removed from P and added to X. An early pruning strategy is also used: if the size of R plus the number of vertices in P is less than or equal to the size of the largest clique found so far, the recursion stops early, saving computational time..</p>
